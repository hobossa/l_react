- Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
    - https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project

- In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
    - https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

- You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
